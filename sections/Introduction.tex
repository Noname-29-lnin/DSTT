\section{INTRODUCTION}

The ability to discern and leverage user preferences has become a commercially significant endeavor, catalyzing substantial advancements in recommendation systems across prominent digital platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, and Shopee. These platforms invest heavily in sophisticated algorithms to meticulously analyze user behavior, thereby enabling the delivery of highly personalized product or content suggestions. For instance, Spotify curates custom playlists based on individual listening patterns, while YouTube utilizes machine learning to recommend videos aligned with a user's prior viewing history. This report aims to explore the underlying patterns in user preferences by applying linear algebra techniques to the extensive MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of ratings from a diverse user base. Through a comparative analysis of these ratings, this report will develop a recommendation framework designed to suggest items to users based on the preferences of those with similar tastes, employing established similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance, scalar product and Pearson correlation.
